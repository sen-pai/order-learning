# order-learning

### Dataset Assumptions
For a problem that requires an order to be learnt, availability of the following two datasets is assumed: 

* $D_{main}$ : A dataset of $x_i$ which ultimately we would like to predict the order between any two members. 
* $D_{comp}$ : A dataset consisting of ordered tuples $(x_i, x_j, o)$, where $o \in {\geq, \leq, \sim }$

### Ranking Color Gradient
